# rampOC
This package, named RampOC, includes the Matlab codes of oil spill   classifications.

* to run the codes please 

  set the matlab paths by simply  running 
     foapl_setup 
  or adding the following path manually to the Matlab
path  './',  'interface','lib_m','lib_pu','libsvm-3.23\windows'

* folders:

  ./lib_m: consists of  the basic functions of general usage (some of them are not used)

  ./lib_pu: consists the functions of  oil spill classifications

  ./interface: consists of the interfaces of RampOC method (it named ``foapl''
in the codes ) 

   ./demo: some demos of the interface of RampOC method (it named ``foapl''
in the codes ) 


  ./libsvm-3.23: LibSVM package 

  ./experiment_oil_classification: main functions  of the experiments of oil spill classifications
  
  ./config:  an old  file of parameter settings, please neglect it. 

* The files could be used freely for your research once you cite the following work
